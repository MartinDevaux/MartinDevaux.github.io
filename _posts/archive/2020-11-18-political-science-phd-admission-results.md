After applying to PhD programs in 2019, I made a simple app using self-reported results from <a href="https://www.thegradcafe.com/" target="_blank">GradCafe</a> to look up the history of admission decisions and know when I could expect to hear back.

Select the **school** you have applied to and **hover over past admission decisions (the colored dots)** to get an idea of when you might expect results this year.
