My name is Martin Devaux and I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. I study comparative politics and political methodology.

Substantively, I study immigration politics in developed democracies. My dissertation work is on the local impact of immigrant-owned businesses on community attitudes toward immigration, with a focus on France. I also care about the housing affordability crisis and the persistence of concentrated poverty in cities. In another project, I study how the interaction of local politicians and residents shapes the production of public housing.

My current methodological interests revolve around the external validity of experiments. You can find <a href="https://naokiegami.com/paper/external_robust.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> the working paper I co-authored with Naoki Egami on Robustness to External Validity Bias, and <a href="https://github.com/naoki-egami/exr" target="_blank">here</a> the associated R package. I am separately working on the decomposition of systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in multisite experiments and meta-analyses.

Prior to my PhD, I was an Associate at <a href="https://www.idinsight.org/" target="_blank">IDinsight</a>, and an MPA student at the London School of Economics.
