My name is Martin Devaux and I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. I study comparative politics and political methodology.

Substantively, I study urban politics in developed democracies. I am in particular interested in the housing affordability crisis and the persistence of concentrated poverty in cities. My dissertation work is on the political economy of public housing with a focus on France: how do local politicians, bureaucrats, residents, and private developers interact to shape the production of public housing?

My current methodological interests revolve around the external validity of experiments. You can find <a href="https://naokiegami.com/paper/external_robust.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> the working paper I co-authored with Naoki Egami on Robustness to External Validity Bias, and <a href="https://github.com/naoki-egami/exr" target="_blank">here</a> the associated R package. I am separately working on the decomposition of systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in multisite experiments and meta-analyses.

Prior to my PhD, I was an Associate at <a href="https://www.idinsight.org/" target="_blank">IDinsight</a>, and an MPA student at the London School of Economics.
