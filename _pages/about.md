My name is Martin Devaux and I am a third-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. I study political methodology and comparative politics. Prior to my PhD, I was an Associate at <a href="https://www.idinsight.org/" target="_blank">IDinsight</a>, and an MPA student at the London School of Economics.

My current methodological interests revolve around the external validity of experiments. You can find <a href="https://naokiegami.com/paper/external_robust.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> the working paper I co-authored with Naoki Egami on Robustness to External Validity Bias, and <a href="https://github.com/naoki-egami/exr" target="_blank">here</a> the associated R package. I am separately working on the decomposition of variation in experimental treatment effect across contexts.

My current substantive interests include collective action, group formation, and legislative activity in advanced economies.
