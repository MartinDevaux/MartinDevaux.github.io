My name is Martin Devaux and I am a third-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. I study comparative politics and political methodology. Prior to my PhD, I was an Associate at <a href="https://www.idinsight.org/" target="_blank">IDinsight</a>, and an MPA student at the London School of Economics.

Substantively, my research focuses on the politics of urban poverty in developed democracies. I want to understand the local political economy that contributes to the persistence of concentrated urban poverty in wealthy economies.

My current methodological interests revolve around the external validity of experiments. You can find <a href="https://naokiegami.com/paper/external_robust.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> the working paper I co-authored with Naoki Egami on Robustness to External Validity Bias, and <a href="https://github.com/naoki-egami/exr" target="_blank">here</a> the associated R package. I am separately working on the decomposition of systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in multisite experiments and meta-analyses.
