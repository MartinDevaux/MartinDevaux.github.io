My name is Martin Devaux and I am a fourth-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. I study comparative politics and political methodology. Prior to my PhD, I was an Associate at <a href="https://www.idinsight.org/" target="_blank">IDinsight</a>, and an MPA student at the London School of Economics.

Substantively, I study urban politics in developed democracies. I want to understand the local factors that contribute to the persistence of concentrated poverty in wealthy economies and to social policy failures. I currently work on the political economy of public housing in France.

My current methodological interests revolve around the external validity of experiments. You can find <a href="https://naokiegami.com/paper/external_robust.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> the working paper I co-authored with Naoki Egami on Robustness to External Validity Bias, and <a href="https://github.com/naoki-egami/exr" target="_blank">here</a> the associated R package. I am separately working on the decomposition of systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in multisite experiments and meta-analyses.
