Welcome to my website! My research focuses on the political economy of immigration in Western democracies.
My dissertation examines the politics of immigrant entrepreneurship, a distinctive way immigrants bring their cultural identity into the economy.
I show that understanding the politics of entrepreneurship at the local level helps understand voting behaviors at the national level,
bridges economic and cultural explanations for native attitudes, and develops contact theory to incorporate a broader conception of exposure.

I also study the political determinants of immigrant entrepreneurship and the consequence of discrimination on immigrants' own political behavior.
Methodologically, I seek to create quantitative methods that help applied researchers be thoughtful about the external validity of their research.
